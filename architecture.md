<p>This is architecture.md</p>

The primary requirements that drove our architecture decision were the 3D/VR implementation, including basic game controls, because the game is very user-centered and we want the users to have a large influence in the design. 

We chose the Agile Architecture style because we wanted a style that accommodates changes in requirements over time. With the development of a video game there is a need for adaptability and testability. We also like how much team cooperation is emphasized with an agile architecture.
