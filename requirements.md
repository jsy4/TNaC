## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of Product

The program we are trying to create is a 3D/VR game that implements melee combat against enemies that can move around and attack the user. The user will be able to move around, pick up weapons, and level up in our game.


### 1.2 Scope of Product

The product will allow the user to explore different maps and fight the waves of enemies. The player will be able to move around the map with enemies spawned from the set spawn locations. This game is aiming for four levels in total and will become harder as it progresses to upper number levels. The enemies will be balls for the easier levels and hopefully ragdolls for the more harder ones. Also, when enemies are killed, they will drop weapons that will help to increase the amount of damage that the player does and increase survivability.


### 1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions

TNaC (Three is Not a Crowd) - The developer group name  
Maps / Lv - the different 3D levels with unique themes and difficulty. Lv is an abbreviation for level.  
Attackers / enemies - Non-playable characters that the user must fend off in each level in order to advance in the game. Ragdoll is the name we are using to describe the models of the enemies.  
Hearts - This will be the player's health.  
Product / project / game - refers to the project Virtual Retaliate.  
Main page - displays all the levels and user setting.  
Level design - level themes.  
Gears - computer / VR headset and joy sticks.

## 2. General Description of Product
Our product will be built in Unity as a 3D/VR game where you will be a first-person character going walking around a 3D environment fighting against waves of enemies. As a player, you will be able to fight these waves of enemies coming at you and gain experience points, pick up weapons dropped randomly by enemies, and level up. When leveling up, you will be able to distribute your experience points and be able to improve your stats, including but not limited to health, damage done, and damage taken. We have also decided that the health system we will be using for the player will be hearts, and you will not be able to heal while in your current level, but instead once you beat the level and move onto the next stage you will fully heal. This will incentivise players to be careful and work efficiently, safely, and tactfully when fighting enemies rather than being reckless. Also, when defeating an enemy, they will have a small chance to drop a pre-set weapon from a table of potential drops. As levels progress, the weapons within the table will improve in terms of quality, damage, and possibly the rate at which weapons would drop as well.


### 2.1 Context of Product
The product will ideally operate in a virtual reality setting. The user will wear a headset to look around the maps, while moving using handheld controllers with buttons and joysticks. If not, it would be a computer game.


### 2.2 Domain Model with Description
![sampleModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65105285/112574367-b9c09300-8db3-11eb-93e5-bc9bce23f6f2.png?raw=true)
Main menu allows Player to choose weapons and select Levels. 
Player has Hp = 10, Lv = 1 from the starting of the game. When contacting enemy, player healpth decreases and when dead, player goes to main page with Hp set to 10 again.
Enemy is decreased by choice of player's Weapon and spawns from set locations and drops items when dead.


### 2.3 Product Functions (general)
Basic overview of the capabilities of your product. This is not your list of functional requirements, but an overview. Part of your problem statement might be good here.
The product is able to run
 
 
### 2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations
Our users will be in first-person, with the ability to look around the 3D environment and move freely in any direction with the confines of the current level. They will not be able to jump or sprint (move faster than standard walking), but they will be able attack enemies with melee weapons. They will also be able to acquire better weapons and level up with experience from killing enemies to increase health and damage.


### 2.5 Constraints
Player health will not be able to be refilled at any point during a level. The player/user will get a certain amount of hearts at the beginning of the level depending on difficulty and player experience. At the beginning of each level the player's health will be returned to full.


### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
For our game, we will be requiring that for the full experience the user will be using a Virtual Reality equiptment in order to look around and traverse the environment. However, if they do not have access to these devices then we will have a built in option to use keyboard and mouse bindings. For system assumptions, the user will need to have a system that is able to run Unity and connect to the VR headset. This is quite demanding, so Iâ€™m sure not all users will be able to run our game.
